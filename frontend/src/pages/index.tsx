//* Importing React from "react". Required to write components in React.
import React from "react";

// import Learn from "@/components/Learn";

//* Declaring the HomePage component as a functional component (React.FC) with TypeScript. React.FC stands for Functional Component, it's a type provided by React for functional components.
const Output: React.FC = () => {
  //* The component returns the Home component as its output.
  return <HomePage />;
  // return <Learn />;
};
